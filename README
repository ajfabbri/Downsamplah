MP3 Downsampler
Aaron Fabbri, 2004
----------------

The MP3 Downsampler creates a copy of your entire .mp3 music collection,
re-encoding the files at a lower bitrate. This allows you to encode your CD's at
a high quality setting for archival purposes, and then also create lower-quality
versions so you can fit more songs on your portable mp3 player. (written in
Python)



Runs on Linux. Will run on other OS's with some simple modificaitons.

Requirements
----------------

The following support software is not included unless otherwise noted:

- Python (probably version 2.2 or later).

- Lame MP3 encoder. You can use other encoders if you like, just edit the
  beginning of the downsamplah.py file.

- An MP3 decoder, such as mpg321.

- ID3-py, included.

Getting Started
----------------

1. Edit the beginning of the downsamplah.py file to match your platform.  Which
   encoder/decoder your platform uses, and where it's located need to be
   configured. 

2. Run 'python downsamplah.py' with no arguments for usage information.
